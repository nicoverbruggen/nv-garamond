## What is this?

NV Garamond is an [EB Garamond](https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond) variant, with adjusted metrics and a 10% glyph size increase. This makes it ideal for digital reading on e-readers.

It serves a similar purpose to [EB Garamond Absinthe](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3739272&postcount=404) as found on the MobileRead Forums, but other than some resized glyphs and adjusted metrics it does not contain any other alterations (default number symbols remain, for example).

## How was this made?

Using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/). You too can learn how to [scale glyphs](https://www.fonttutorials.com/how-to-scale-glyphs/), [adjust metrics](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/Line_Spacing.html) and [generate a font](https://www.fonttutorials.com/how-to-fix-font-abg-thumbnails/#generating-your-font).

I've included the FontForge files in this repository.

## Versions

There is one version included in the repo:

- **NV Garamond**: With adjusted metrics and a minor size bump. Because this one starts thinner and at a tight line spacing, you have more control over the precise weight and line spacing on Kobo devices.

For an optimized Kobo version, please see my [other repository](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/ebook-fonts) and look for the KF version of Garamond.
